The tools described in this section are reached through the <b>Tools</b> menu on the top menu bar. 
All of the tools create new objects, some create spline or triangle meshes which are then 
editable in the ways described in the <a href="object%20types.html">previous section</a>.<br>

<br>

<br>

<a name="array"><strong><font color="#ff6633" size="4">2.2.1 Array</font></strong></a><br>

<br>

<br>

This tool can create several objects as copies of any existing object. Clicking on an object 
in the Object List and selecting <b>Array</b> from the <b>Tools</b> menu brings up the 
following dialogue box:<br>

<br>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>

      <td><img src="modelling/array_dialogue.jpg"></td>

      <td><font face="tahoma" size="2">
Copies can be made along a straight line (<b>Linear</b>) or along a pre-defined curve. In the 
      <b>Linear</b> option, the number of copies is specified and the direction along which to put the 
copied objects, i.e. x, y or z, by specifying a number in the <b>Step X</b>, <b>Step Y</b> and <b>Step Z</b> 
boxes. This number is the spacing of the resulting objects which can either be 
defined in terms of the object size (tick <b>Times X Size</b> or whichever direction you want) 
or in absolute units (leave boxes unticked). For example, specifying 1 in the <b>Step X</b> 
box and ticking the <b>Times X Size</b> box will produce copies running along the x-axis that 
will just be touching. Copies running along any vector can be defined by 
specifying steps in more than one <b>Step X/Y/Z</b> box as shown below:<br>

      <img src="modelling/array_x_y_z.jpg"></font></td>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<br>
<br>

<table style="width: 840px; height: 652px;">

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 500px;"><font face="tahoma" size="2">
Using the <b>From Curve</b> option allows the copied objects to be created along a path defined 
by an existing curve which can be selected from the pull down menu. Copies are spaced 
evenly along the curve and the number is either explicitly specified or calculated from 
the specified <b>Step Size</b> (in units). The orientation of the copied objects can 
either follow that of the curve or be fixed at that of the original (untick <b>Orientation 
Follows Curve</b>). In addition, the original position and orientation can be used to form 
the basis for the position and orientation of the copies.<br>

      <br>

In the example on the right, the Array tool has been used to create some wheel spokes. In this case 
a approximating smoothing polygon was used to produce a circular path. The original 
cylinder was positioned as shown and its orientation and position were used and 
'Orientation Follows Curve' was ticked.

The tick boxes at the bottom of the dialogue determine further options:<br>

<br>

<b>Include Children</b> means that children of the object to be copied will be copied as well.<br>

<br>

<b>Group</b> means that the objects created by the Array tool will be grouped together under a Null
object parent.<br>

<br>

<b>Skip First Copy</b> means that the first copy will not be made.  This is useful if you want the 
original object to be one of the array.<br>

<br>

<b>Live Duplicates</b> means that the objects created by the Array tool are 'live', i.e. changes
made thereafter to the original object will be automatically applied to the copies.<br>

<br>
 
<br>

<a name="extrude"><strong><font color="#ff6633" size="4">2.2.2 Extrude</font></strong></a><br>

<br>

This tool creates a spline mesh object by extending a curve along an axis or another curve.
Take the example below. On the left is a closed curve made using the approximating 
curve tool. Selecting <b>Extrude</b> from the <b>Tools</b> menu produces the dialogue box 
shown below right:<br>

<br>

<img src="modelling/extrude_ex1.jpg">
<img src="modelling/extrude_ex2.jpg">
<br>

<br>

The curve has been pulled along the z-axis in this example to produce a cylinder-like 
spline object. The resulting object is displayed on the right of the Extrude dialogue 
box and can be rotated around by clicking and dragging over the object in order to 
better visualise it. In this particular example, because the curve lies in the x-y 
plane, extruding along either the x- or y-axis will produce a 2-D object and extruding 
along the z-axis creates an object with sides perpendicular to the original curve. 
The length of extrusion can also be specified in the<b> Distance </b>box.<br>

<br>

Extrusion in a different direction can be achieved by defining a vector in the Extrude 
dialogue as shown in the examples below:<br>

<img src="modelling/extrude_exs.jpg"><br>

<br>

The extrude tool can also produce twisted extrusions by entering a <b>twist</b> 
angle in the appropriate box as shown below:<br>

<br>

The number of segments, i.e. divisions along the extrusion axis, can also be defined. 
Altering the <b>number of segments</b> can make a difference to a twisted object:
<br>

<br>

<img src="modelling/ext_twist.jpg">
<img src="modelling/ext_twist_seg.jpg"><br>

<br>

It is also possible to extrude one curve along another. In this case, the 
extruded curve is pulled along the path defined by the second curve. The example below 
illustrates this. Two curves were created in perpendicular planes (shown in Front and Top 
views). Both curves need to be selected in the Object List, then click on <b>Tools -&gt; 
Extrude</b>. This brings up the same dialogue box as before. Now, however, the <b>Extrude 
Direction -&gt;</b> <b>Curve</b> option becomes available. Clicking this option and 
selecting Curve 2 produces the result shown top right. Extruding Curve 2 along Curve 1 
produces the object shown on bottom right.
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>

      <td><img src="modelling/curve_curve_ex1.jpg"></td>

      <td><img src="modelling/curve_curve_ex2.jpg"><br>
      <br>
      <img src="modelling/curve_curve_ex3.jpg"></td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

The orientation of the extruded curve can also be specified to follow that of the 
curve it is extruded along by clicking <b>Orientation Follows Curve</b>. 
This causes the extruded curve to be always perpendicular to the tangent of the 
path curve rather than maintaining a static orientation along the path. The difference 
this makes is shown below:<br>

<br>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="modelling/extrude_ex.jpg"></td>

      <td><img src="modelling/extrude_orient1.jpg"><br>

      <i><font size="2">Orientation follows curve</font><br>

      <img src="modelling/extrude_orient2.jpg"><br>

      <i><font size="2">Static Orientation</font><br>
      </i>
      </td>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

The Extrude tool can also be used on open spline meshes and triangle meshes and, 
in both cases, a triangle mesh is the result. In this example, a flat spline mesh was 
produced using the spline tool<img src="modelling/spline_icon.jpg"> .This was edited to produce the 
shape shown and was then extruded using the Extrude tool.<br>

<br>

When extruding meshes, the <b>surface accuracy </b>can be specified and, as with other 
tools, this determines the number of points defining the resulting mesh.<br>

<img src="modelling/extrude_spline_spline.jpg">
<img src="modelling/extrude_spline.jpg"><br>

The effect of altering the surface accuracy in this example is shown below:<br>

<img src="modelling/extrude_surf_acc.jpg">
<br>

<br>

<a name="lathe"><strong><font color="#ff6633" size="4">2.2.3 Lathe</font></strong></a><br>

<br>

The Lathe tool operates on a single curve. The operation sweeps the curve around a 
defined axis or vector and produces a spline mesh. Highlighting a curve from the Object 
List and selecting Lathe from the Tool menu produces the following 
dialogue box:<br>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>

      <td><img src="modelling/lathe_curve.jpg"><br>

      <i><font face="tahoma" size="1">Curve used in lathe example</font><br>
      </i></td>

      <td><img src="modelling/lathe_dialogue.jpg"></td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br>


The curve object can be lathed around the x, y or z axes or around the line joining the 
end of the curve. The angle of sweep can be defined - anything less than 360 degrees 
produces an open surface. The <b>radius </b>is the distance between the centre of the 
curve and the axis of sweep so a bigger<b> radius </b>in the example above would produce 
a bigger hole in the middle of the torus. More typically, one might want to use the 
lathe tool to create something like a wine glass:<br>

<img src="modelling/lathe_curve_glass.jpg">
<img src="modelling/lathe_wineglass.jpg"><br>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>

      <td style="width: 600px;"><font face="tahoma" size="2">In this case, you will need to play around with the<b> radius </b>to get the required 
shape.<br>

      <br>

The number of <b>segments</b> controls how many points are created in the resulting 
spline mesh as shown on the right. Having more points means having more control on 
the resulting object.<br>

      <br>

Note that to create a vase/glass etc. with some actual thickness, you will need to 
create a closed curve like the following:<br>

<a name="skin"><strong><font color="#ff6633" size="4">2.2.4 Skin</font></strong></a><br>

<br>

This tool fits a 'skin' to a series of curves which define the cross section at that 
point. All the curves must have the same number of points and must all be either 
open or closed, not a mixture of the two. The example below shows the spline surface 
skin produced from 3 polygons. Note that, in order for the curves to have the same 
number of points it was necessary to edit the triangle and square objects to make up the 
number of points to 5 (to match the pentagon). This was done by double-clicking the 
curve, selecting 2 adjacent points and selecting <b>Curve -&gt; Subdivide Selection. </b> 
This was performed once for the square and twice for the triangle.<br>

<br>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>

      <td style="width: 600px;"><font face="tahoma" size="2">Highlighting all 3 curves in the <b>Object List</b> and 
selecting <b>Tools -&gt; Skin</b> brings up the dialogue box on the right:<br>

      <br>

The curve order can be rearranged as required by selecting on a curve in the left hand 
list and moving it up or down. The direction in which the points are joined can also 
be reversed.<br>

<a name="boolean"><strong><font color="#ff6633" size="4">2.2.5 Boolean Modelling</font></strong></a><br>

<br>

Boolean Modelling is a powerful way of making complicated geometry relatively simply by 
combining existing geometry in one of 4 ways. The Boolean tool currently works on 
2 objects, one of which must be solid. To combine the objects, select both either 
from a view window or the <b>Object List</b> and click on <b>Tools -&gt; Boolean Modelling.</b>
A dialogue window similar to those below appears allowing the selection of the type 
of Operation: Union, Intersection, First-Second and Second-First. 
Union creates a new object which is the addition of the 2 objects, 
Intersection creates a new object of the part of the objects that overlap and the other 
2 are geometry subtractions. The images below show the effects of each operation 
on 2 squashed spheres. <br>

<img src="modelling/booleans.jpg"><br>

<br>

Clicking on OK produces a new object, the original objects still being retained and 
completely independent of the new Boolean object. The objects making up the new 
Boolean object, however, remain editable by double-clicking the Boolean object in the 
Object List or selecting the object and clicking <b>Object -&gt; Edit Object 
</b>from the top menu. This brings up the Boolean editor which allows transformations 
of the component objects and the re-selection, if required, of the operator performed on 
them:<br>

<img src="modelling/boolean_editor.jpg"><br>

<br>

The icons on the left are the same as some on the main layout window. The Edit menu 
allows the Boolean operation to be re-defined through<b> Edit -&gt; Properties</b>. 
The Object menu allows transformations and editing similar to the main layout screen 
Object Menu .<a href="editing%20objects.html"></a><br>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 600px;"><font face="tahoma" size="2">
A more complicated example gives an idea of what the Boolean tool is capable of. 
We start off with a Boolean made from a difference of two cylinders, one inside another 
(but taller). The Union image shows the 2 objects clearly. Selecting the First-Second 
operation gives the desired effect.<br>

      <br>

Clicking OK gives the first stage of the turret. Now we add a cube scaled so that it 
extends beyond the newly-created 'crater' as below left. Copy and pasting (
or using the Array tool with a suitable curve) produces copies of this cube around 
the top of the soon-to-be turret (bottom right). These cubes are Unioned successively 
with the Boolean tool until they form one Boolean object (delete the original 
objects and the intermediate Booleans as you go).</font></td>

Again the image on the left shows the objects clearly. Selecting First-Second produces the 
turret we are after on the right. Clearly through further use of the Boolean tool, 
a more complicated and realistic model can be built up.<br>

      <br>

Bear in mind also that, like other geometric objects, the resulting Boolean 
object can be converted to a triangle mesh which allows more detailed refinements 
and the application of the various smoothing methods.<br>

<a name="tube"><strong><font color="#ff6633" size="4">2.2.6 Tube</font></strong></a><br>

<br>

The Tube tool is applied to a curve and produces a <a href="object_types.html#tubes">Tube Object</a>
which is basically a circular cross-sectioned extrusion along the curve.<br>

<br>

To create a Tube Object, select the curve in the Object List and choose <b>Tools -&gt; Tube...</b>.  This
will display the Tube dialogue window.  The image below shows a curve object and the Tube dialogue
produced:<br>

<br>

<img src="modelling/tube_create.jpg"><br>

<br>

The dialogue allows the <b>Tube Width</b> or diameter to be specified and this is used along the
whole length of the tube.  Note, however, that the width can be set at any point along the tube in the
Tube Object editor (see <a href="object_types.html#tubes">Tube Objects</a>).<br>

<br>

The <b>Cap Ends</b> option allows the tube to have either open ends or flat, capped ends.  Once created,
tube objects can also have their ends joined together within the <a href="object_types.html#tubes">editor</a>.<br>

<br>

<br>

<a name="text"><strong><font color="#ff6633" size="4">2.2.7 Text</font></strong></a><br>

<br>

<br>

The Text tool creates objects that represent text in various ways.  To use it, choose <b>Tools -&gt; Text...</b>.  This
will display the Text dialogue window.

<p>

<img src="modelling/text.png">

<p>

The dialogue allows you to specify the <b>Text</b> to generate and the <b>Font</b> and style (<b>Bold</b> or <b>Italic</b>)
to use.  You can then select any of four object types to create:
<p>
<b>Outline</b> creates a set of <a href="object_types.html#curves">Curve Objects</a> that trace the outline of the text.
<p>
<b>Tubes</b> is like Outline, but it creates <a href="object_types.html#tubes">Tube Objects</a> instead of curves.  You can choose
the <b>Thickness</b> of the curves it generates.
<p>
<b>Surface</b> creates a 2-dimensional <a href="object_types.html#triangle_meshes">Triangle Mesh</a> representing the text.
<p>
<b>Solid</b> is similar to Surface, but the mesh is extruded to create a solid 3-dimensional object.  You can select
the thickness of the extruded mesh.
