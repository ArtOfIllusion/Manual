Once textures have been created, they need to be assigned to the
relevant object. To do this, select
the object(s) from the Object List and click on <b>Object
-&gt; Set Texture and Material</b>. This displays a
dialogue similar to that below:<br>

<br>

<table>

  <tbody>

      <td><img src="textures/assign_texture_dial.png"></td>

      <td width="400"><font face="tahoma" size="2">On the left of this dialogue is a list of defined
textures. Clicking on
one shows the result as applied to a sphere as in the texture creation

<br>

<b><font size="4">Types of Mapping</font></b><br>

<br>

For procedural 3D textures, there is only one choice: <b>Linear</b>.
This is because 3D textures are 'solid' and the object to which they
are assigned will look as though it has been carved out of it.<br>

<br>

For image maps and procedural 2D textures, the texture is wrapped
around the object and this can be done
in various ways. In this case, the type of mapping is either <b>Projection,
Cylindrical, Spherical or UV</b>.<br>

<br>

<b>Projection</b> applies the texture as though it is cast
by a slide projector onto the object. This will work well
for flat objects but will result in distortions where there is sharp
curvature such as in the example below. In this example, the
texturelooks OK until it wraps around the side where the texture
appears to stretch. Altering the projection to <b>Cylindrical</b>
gives a better result for this object and <b>Spherical</b>
also gives a reasonable result:<br>

<img src="textures/mapping_types.jpg"><br>

The type of mapping that is best depends on the geometry of the object.
Cylindrical and Spherical mapping
work by wrapping the texture around the object such that the texture
would perfectly fit around a
cylinder or sphere respectively. So if objects are geometrically
similar to cylinders and spheres, these
types of mapping will work reasonably well.<br>

<br>

In most cases, however, objects are not flat or perfectly cylindrical
or spherical. That's where
<b>UV</b> mapping comes in. UV mapping allows complete
control of the placement of texture coordinates
on mesh objects allowing textures to be mapped exactly as required. See
<a href="#uv_map">later</a> for details.<br>

<br>

<br>

<b><font size="4">Altering Mapping Parameters</font></b><br>

<br>

Having selected the type of mapping, we can now make the texture fit
the object by altering the mapping parameters.<br>

<br>

For procedural 3D textures for which we have the <b>Linear</b>
mapping, we can alter the Scale, Centre
and Rotation as shown in the texture mapping dialogue above. The <b>Scale</b>
alters the size of the
texture, the <b>Centre</b> controls its position and the <b>Rotation</b>
affects its orientation. Each
of these parameters can be specified for the x,y and z axes. As in the
main layout, <b>y</b> is up and down, <b>x</b>
is left and right and <b>z</b> is forwards and backwards.<br>

<br>

<table>

  <tbody>

    <tr>

      <td><img src="textures/scale_textures_dial.jpg"></td>

      <td width="600"><font face="tahoma" size="2">There is another
option available -&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Scale_Texture"></a>Scale Texture to Object</span>-
which also allows the texture to be automatically scaled to the
object as shown in the example below. &nbsp;If this option is enabled,
then the scale and centre set in this dialogue are relative to the size
of the object (actually its bounding box) with 0 being one edge of
object and 1 being the other edge.&nbsp; This automatically updates the
texture mapping as the object is scaled.<br>

      <br>

      <img src="textures/tex_scale_ex.jpg" style="width: 417px; height: 228px;" alt=""><br>
 </font></td>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

<table>

  <tbody>

    <tr>

      <td><img src="textures/linear_proj_change.jpg"></td>

      <td width="600"><font face="tahoma" size="2">In this example of applying a texture to a mesh object, the 'lizard skin' texture has been
scaled by 0.5 in each dimension to reduce the size of the lizard's scales.<br>

      <br>

A rotation of 45 degrees around the z-axis has also been applied
resulting in stripes that slope down obliquely.<br>

      <br>

If the object is a mesh, then a further option is available:<a name="bind"></a> <b>Bind
Texture Coordinates to Surface</b>.
If checked, the texture will transform with the mesh as it undergoes
any mesh transformations or deformations.
If left unchecked, then the mesh will 'move' through the texture as it
transforms. This is illustrated below.
The object is a sphere converted to a triangle mesh and the procedural
3D texture used is shown on the
original object. A simple scaling is applied to the object in the mesh
editor both with and without
binding on. The object with no binding scales through the texture while
the one with binding shows the texture scaling with the mesh. <br>

      <img src="textures/tex_binding.jpg"> </font></td>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

<br>

The final option on the dialogue is whether to apply the texture to
both sides of the surface or to
one side only. The difference is only evident on an open surface. In
the example below is a spline
mesh bent back on itself. Applying the texture to both sides means that
the whole object is visible
whereas applying it to the front or back sides only makes the opposite
side appear invisible.<br>

<img src="textures/front_back_faces.jpg"><br>

One important use of being able to map to one side only is with <a href="#layered_tex">layered textures</a> where you
could
choose to have different textures mapped to <a href="#layered_sides">different sides</a>.<br>

<br>

<br>

For procedural 2D and image mapped textures, the options for mapping
are projection, cylindrical and spherical. The mapping parameters
available for editing depend on the type of mapping.<br>

<br>

<br>

Although UV mapping is another way in which 2D textures can be wrapped
around objects as above, it warrants
it own section due to its versatility.<br>

<br>

Essentially UV mapping allows you to control how the texture is scaled,
rotated etc. over the mesh's surface
(UV mapping only works with meshes). It works by assigning texture
coordinates (UV coordinates) to each mesh vertex. U and V are the
symbols used to represent the horizontal and vertical axes of
the texture.<br>

<br>

The first stage in UV mapping in Art of Illusion is to attempt to map
the texture in the conventional way using projection, cylindrical or
spherical mapping and adjusting the scaling, centering and orientation.
Once the mapping is as close as possible to that required, select UV
from the drop down <b>Mapping</b> menu. This takes you to
a new dialogue. Click on <b>Edit UV Coordinates</b> to
display the main UV mapping dialogue similar to that below. The
dialogue is a little complicated so we'll look at it in detail.<br>

<br>

In the top right corner is the mesh itself shown with a Smooth preview
surface. This view can be panned, rotated and zoomed in the same way as
in the mesh editor and vertices can also be selected (but not moved)
in the normal way.<br>

<br>

Below right shows the mesh with the texture mapped to it. As with the
normal texture mapping preview, this can be rotated by dragging within
the window.<br>

<br>

The left side of the dialogue shows the texture itself. You can choose
to display various components
of the texture, e.g. diffuse colour, specular values, emissive colour,
to aid the mapping process via
the <b>Displayed Component </b> drop down menu. You can
also choose to display low, medium or high
resolution versions of the texture via the <b>Resolution</b>
drop down menu. This does not actually
change the texture in any way; it just affects the way it is displayed
- low resolutions will display
quicker than high resolutions.<br>

<br>

The previews can be also resized by dragging out the sides of the whole
dialogue window.<br>

<br>

Below these menus is some information showing the range of the texture
being displayed. The <b>
Displayed Coordinate Range </b> shows the range of U and V
coordinates currently being displayed in the
texture view. If you need to see further out, adjust the range by
increasing the U and V values. To zoom in, reduce the values. <a name="UV_move">Alternatively </a> you can pan and
zoom the texture view by clicking on the camera pan icon <img src="basics/camera_pan.jpg"> (hold down CTRL while dragging
to zoom) or by dragging with the right mouse button depressed (again
with CTRL to zoom).<br>

<br>

To alter the texture mapping in a particular position on the mesh's
surface, select the vertex/vertices at
that position on the mesh view. This will result in the corresponding
texture coordinates being marked
on the texture view as small crosses; a cross for each mesh vertex (see
below left). The crosses can
themselves then be selected by clicking on the select/move icon (top
left icon), selecting the crosses
by clicking on them (shift-click to add to selection, ctrl-click to
deselect, click-drag to select all
points within a rectangular marquee). If you have single points
selected in the texture view, then their UV position is displayed (and
can
be edited) in the dialogue under <b>Selected Vertex Coordinates</b>.
If more than one cross is selected, then only
U or V coordinates that are shared by all will be displayed. Selected
crosses can then be moved, scaled,
rotated, skewed etc. using the icons at the top. Altering their
positions will result in the texture being moved over the mesh's
surface and the texture preview will show these changes in real time.
<br>

<img src="textures/uvex1.jpg"><br>

In the example above, we're trying to map a snakeskin texture to a
head. There are a few problem areas - the image above left shows
stretching of the texture around the side of the head. Selecting some
vertices
in part of this area brings up their corresponding texture coordinates
on the texture view. In this case,
we want to scale the texture coordinates to compensate for the
stretching. The UV coordinates before and
after are shown above left and right respectively. This has improved
the texture mapping.<br>

<br>

Below shows another problem area - around the side of the neck, again,
the texture is stretched. Again,
select the vertices on the mesh view, and stretch the corresponding
texture parameters to begin to solve the
problem (below right).<br>

<br>

<img src="textures/uvex2.jpg"><br>

<br>

<a name="UV_face"></a>
The final point to note is the <b>Map Each Face Independently</b>
option. Switching this on will switch
the mesh view to face mode. The vertices that make up each face can be
mapped in UV space as before except
that the vertices in effect 'belong' to that face - if you select an
adjacent face (which shares vertex
mesh positions), its vertices can be mapped completely independently
even though they are spatially at the
same position. This allows discrete changes in UV mapping over the
surface.<br>

<br>

<br>

<a name="layered_tex"><strong><font color="#ff6633" size="4">4.1.6 Using Layered Textures</font></strong></a><br>

<br>

Art of Illusion allows multiple textures to be applied to the same
surface through the use of layered
textures. To create a layered texture, select the object, click on <b>Object
-&gt; Set Texture and Material</b> and
choose <b>Layered Texture</b> from the <b>Type</b>
drop-down menu at the top of the dialogue box. A
dialogue similar to that shown below will be displayed:<br>

<br>

<table>

  <tbody>

    <tr>

      <td><img src="textures/layered_tex.png"></td>

      <td><font face="tahoma" size="2">At the
left of the dialogue is a list of all the textures that have
been created in the scene. To add
one of these to the layered texture, select it from this list and click
on <b>Add</b>. This adds the texture to the list in the
centre. This list shows the texture layers and their order is
important. The
topmost layer in this list is the surface layer, the 2nd one is the
next layer down and etc. The order can
be changed by selecting textures and clicking on <b>Move Up</b>.<br>

      <br>

Each layer can be one of 3 <b>Blending Modes</b> selected
from the drop-down menu on the right:<br>

      <br>

      <b>Blend</b> means that a weighted average texture is
created of that texture and the textures below it. The weighting
is defined by the fraction bar to the left of the preview. If this was
set to 0.7, for example, then the
resulting texture would be 70% that one and 30% of the one below. All
texture properties, e.g, diffuse
colour, specularity, transparency etc., are averaged in this way.<br>

      <br>

      <b>Overlay</b> In this case, the current texture is
laid over the ones below with any transparent areas
allowing the textures below to show through and opaque areas will not.
Again a weighting fraction can
be applied which results in partial transparency.<br>

      <br>

      <b>Overlay, Bumps Add</b> is a special version of the
overlay mode where bump and displacement maps sum
through all the layers rather than being averaged or eliminated by
layers above.<br>

      <br>

      </font></td>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

Note that layered textures can also be applied per-vertex, per-face or
per-face-vertex
via <a href="#tex_param">texture parameters</a> by
selecting the appropriate mapping mode from the
drop-down menu next to the fraction bar. See <a href="textures2.html#tex_par_layered">here</a> for
more details.<br>

<br>
<a name="layered_sides"></a>
Layered textures can also be used to set different textures to each
side of an object. &nbsp;In the example below, 2 textures have been
created - one of a photograph and the other of some text. &nbsp;By
creating a layered texture for a flat spline mesh object and adding
both textures, each can then be mapped via Edit Mapping and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Front Faces Only</span> and
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Back Faces Only</span>
options selected for each. &nbsp;The result is a two-sided sheet:<br>

Texture parameters allow textures to be controlled depending on their
position on a mesh surface. A texture
parameter is a numerical value defined in a procedural texture. The
value of this parameter is set within
the mesh editor so that certain parts of a 3D model can have different
values set. The best way to illustrate this is to look at an example.
This example assigns a texture to
a pencil object. Here is the procedural 3D texture:<br>

The values of each of these parameters on the surface of the mesh can

different parameter values. In this case, there is

      <br>

      <b>Per-Face-Vertex</b> - this is similar to per-face

For this example, all 3 of the texture parameters have been set to be
per vertex. Click on OK to assign the texture to the object.<br>

<br>

Now to assign the values to the mesh. Double-click on the object in the
Object List to bring up the
mesh editor:<br>

<table>

  <tbody>

    <tr>

      <td><img src="textures/texture_param_mesh.jpg"></td>

      <td><font face="tahoma" size="2">This
shows the tip of the pencil object with the vertices of the 'lead'
selected in the normal way.
To assign the values of each texture parameter to these vertices,
select <b> Mesh -&gt; Texture Parameters</b>
to display the dialogue shown within the main window on the left:<br>

      <br>

      <b>Pencil_part</b> has been set to 1 which gives a
grey diffuse colour.<br>

      <br>

      <b>Wood_part</b> has been set to 0 since this is not
the wood part.<br>

      <br>

      <b>Shiny</b> is set to 0.2 to give a specularity of
0.2 to be slightly reflective.<br>

      <br>

Assigning appropriate values to the other vertices produces the result
shown below:<br>

There is clearly great flexibility in the control of textures using
texture parameters. One important use
of texture parameters is variation of textures through animation of
texture parameter tracks. See <a href="animation.html#anim_textures">
this section</a> for more details.<br>

<br>

Blending fractions for <a href="textures2.html#layered_tex">layered
textures</a> are also texture parameters and thus can be set
per-vertex, per-face or per-face-vertex and animated in the same way as
any other parameter. Below is an
example showing the use of texture parameters with layered textures.
Here a layered texture is used
to texture the sides of a cube. A cube is created and converted to a
triangle mesh. Textures for
each side of the cube are created as normal; here I have used 3
different sorts of textures for illustration: a uniform one ('green
shiny'), a procedural 2D one ('grid') and a 3D one ('noise bump').<br>

<br>

<table>

  <tbody>

    <tr>

      <td width="400"><font face="tahoma" size="2">A layered texture is created for the mesh cube by
right clicking on the
object in the Object List
-&gt; Set Texture and then selecting Layered Texture at the top of
the dialogue that appears.<br>

      <br>

Now we can add the textures we want to map to the cube. The Blending
Mode is set to 'Blend' for each texture in this case. Note that I have
added another texture ('grey') that will be the background
texture for the cube - any parts of the geometry that are not mapped
with any other texture will take on the
grey texture. This is ensured by setting the mapping mode for this
texture to 'Object'. Because it is
going to form the base layer, it is positioned at the bottom of the
layered texture list. The other
textures are set to be per-face or per-vertex as shown below and on the
right:<br>

      <img src="textures/lay_tex_param_dial2.jpg"> <br>

      </font></td>

      <td><img src="textures/lay_tex_param_dial.jpg"></td>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

<br>

You may need to correctly orient and scale the textures via the <b>Edit
Mapping</b> button to ensure
that the textures for each face will be correctly aligned.<br>

<br>

When done, click OK to leave the dialogue. To actually set the
parameters, enter the Mesh Editor by double-clicking
the cube in the Object List. The 'grid' and 'green shiny' textures can
be set by selecting faces and then
selecting Mesh -&gt; Texture Parameters. The parameter values can
then be entered in the dialogue that appears.
The 'noise bump' texture is set per-vertex so you will need to select
vertices rather than faces before
selecting Mesh -&gt; Texture Parameters. In this example, I chose a
single vertex in the centre of the side
of the cube as shown below:<br>
