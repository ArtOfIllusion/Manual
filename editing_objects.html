<strong><font color="#3300cc" size="5"><b>2.3 Editing Objects</b></font></strong><br>
<br>
Once any of the objects described in section 3.1 have been created, they may be edited at any time. 
To select an object, either click on it in one of the view windows or in the Object List. 
To select multiple objects, hold down &lt;shift&gt; while clicking on the relevant objects 
in the view windows or the Object List or define a marquee selection by holding down the mouse 
button while dragging the mouse across the required images.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="edit object"><font size="4" color="#ff6633"><b>2.3.1 Edit Object</b></font></a><br>
<br>
The Edit Object tool is actioned by selecting <B>Object -&gt; Edit Object </B>or by double clicking 
on the object in the Object List. This tool brings up an object-dependent dialogue box which allows 
varying amounts of editing. For a sphere or cube primitive, a simple dialogue box allows the scaling 
in each axis to be altered. For a cylinder or cone object, there is the ability to alter the 
relative scaling of the base as well as the top/bottom radius ratio and the height.<br>
<img SRC="modelling/edit_sphere.jpg">
<img SRC="modelling/edit_cylind_cone.jpg"><br>
<br>
For curves, spline and triangle meshes, and tubes, the relevant editing window will be displayed as 
discussed in detail in sections <a href="object_types.html#curves">2.1.2</a>, 
<a href="object_types.html#splines">2.1.3</a>, <a href="object_types.html#triangle meshes">2.1.4</a>
and <a href="object_types.html#tubes">2.1.6</a>. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Light editing options are discussed in <a href="lights.html">Chapter 4</a>.<br>
<br>
Camera editing options are discussed in <a href="rendering.html">Chapter 6</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="object layout"><font size="4" color="#ff6633"><b>2.3.2 Object layout<br></b></font></a>
<br>
If you select an object and click on <B>Object -&gt; Object Layout</B>, a dialogue like this example 
will be displayed giving information on the object's position, orientation and scaling.<br>
<table>
<tr><td><img SRC="modelling/object_layout_dialogue.jpg"><br></td>
<td><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Any of the shown fields can be altered allowing accurate definition of the object's position, 
orientation and size. Simply click in the relevant box, type in the new value and click on 'OK' 
to action the change.</font></td></tr>
</table>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<a name="transforming objects"><font size="4" color="#ff6633"><b>2.3.3 Transforming Objects<br></b></font></a>
<br>
Clicking an object and selecting <b>Edit -&gt; Transform Object</b> allows the object to be translated, 
rotated or scaled by a user-defined distance, angle or factor respectively. 
The following dialogue box is displayed:<br>
<br>
<br>
<table>
<tr><td><img SRC="modelling/transform_dialogue.jpg"></td>
<td><font face="Tahoma" size="2">By default, transformations are also performed on children of the selected object and this can be 
turned off from this dialogue box. It is also possible to perform the rotation of a collection 
of objects as if they were separate objects (i.e. around Individual Object Centres) or, 
by default, around the centre of the collection.<br>
<br>
</font></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<br>
Transformations can also be made using the icons on the left of the main screen layout.<br>
<br>
<img SRC="modelling/translate_icon.jpg"> is object translation. Simply click on the icon and drag the object in any of the viewports. &nbsp;Double-clicking brings up a dialogue box to switch off/on translation of non-selected children objects.<br>
<br>
<img SRC="modelling/rotate_icon.jpg"> is object rotation. Again click once on the icon and drag over the object 
to rotate it. The rotation can be constrained to a particular axis by dragging the appropriate handle 
instead. Double-clicking brings up a dialogue box to switch off/on translation of non-selected 
children objects and to change the rotation centre.<br>
<br>
<img SRC="modelling/scale.jpg"> is object scaling. Clicking on this and then dragging a handle scales in 
the appropriate axis. Pressing &lt;shift&gt; while dragging maintains the relative dimensions 
of the object, while pressing &lt;ctrl&gt; keeps the centre of the object fixed. Both can be pressed 
simultaneously to maintain shape and centre. Double clicking brings up a dialogue box to switch 
off/on translation of non-selected children objects and allows for the centres of objects to 
remain fixed or to move in relation to the scaling.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fine editing of object translation and rotation can also be achieved using the arrow keys.  The currently
selected object(s) will be moved/rotated according to the arrow key pressed and the currently selected
view window.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="align objects"><font size="4" color="#ff6633"><b>2.3.4 Align Objects<br></b></font></a>
<br>
This option from the <B>Object </B>menu allows selected objects to be aligned with each other. 
The dialogue box looks like this:<br>
<br>
<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="modelling/align_dial.jpg"></td>
<td><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Objects can be aligned in any axis and with respect to their front, centre, back or origin. 
In addition the objects can be positioned at any particular point along the axis by entering a 
value in the 'align to' box.  For example, selecting Z centre align to 2 will move the centres 
of all selected objects to Z=2 as below:<br>
<img SRC="modelling/align.jpg"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="rename object"><font size="4" color="#ff6633"><b>2.3.5 Rename Object</b></font></a><br>
<br>
New objects in Art of Illusion are given a generic name based on the type of object. 
Copied objects retain the name of the original object. In either case, it becomes far easier to 
give the objects a meaningful name. This is achieved by simply clicking on the object and 
selecting <B>Object -&gt; Rename Object</B>.<br>
<br>
<img SRC="modelling/rename_object.jpg">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="copy object"><font size="4" color="#ff6633"><b>2.3.6 Copying Objects</b></font></a><br>
<br>
Any object can be copied including cameras and lights.  The <b>Cut</b>, <b>Copy</b> and <b>Paste</b>
commands are to be found on the <b>Edit</b> menu.  These commands work in the same way as many other
programs in that <b>Cut</b> and <b>Copy</b> both make a copy of all selected objects in the clipboard
which can then be <b>Paste</b>d to produce an identical copy in the scene. <b>Cut</b> results in the 
original object being deleted.  Objects can also be copied from one scene to another scene in the same way.<br>
<br>
In addition to these commands, there is a special copying command <b>Edit -> Make Live Duplicates</b>.
This produces an identical copy of all selected objects in the same way as <b>Copy</b> but this time
the new object is linked to the original so that all future changes made to any of the linked objects are
automatically applied to all 'live' duplicates.  If and when you want this relationship to stop, select
the copy and click on <b>Edit -> Sever Duplicates</b>.
