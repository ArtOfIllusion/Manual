This material is based on the <b>Grid</b> pattern to which a <b>spherical</b> transform is partly applied.
Note than the R output from the spherical output is not fed into the grid; rather a 0 value is the input
which stretches the grid pattern radially outwards.<br>
<br>
The resulting grid pattern is then evaluated with the <b>greater than</b> function to pick out points within
a radius of 0.03, i.e thin 'spokes' (the Grid spacing is set at 0.1).  This is fed into the density function
so that the 'spokes' have a high density and everywhere else is zero.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Transparency</b> is set to a very low (but non-zero) value to produce a virtually opaque material.<br>
<br>
<br>
Finally, the R output of the <b>Spherical</b> transform is fed into a custom colour map to produce
a pattern whose colour varies with distance from the centre.<br>
<br>
<br>
The <b>Integration Step Size</b> was reduced to 0.01 to allow more accurate rendering of the fine (0.03) spokes.
