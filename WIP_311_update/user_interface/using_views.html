<h1>User interface</h1>

<h2 id="views">Using views</h2>

<p><big>
You have great freedom in how you use the views: 
<ul>
<li>You can look at your model in any orientation or any magnification you like. 
<li>You can move, scale and rotate the viewa while you work. 
<li>You can control cameras and lights through the views.
</ul>
</big></p>

<h3>Display modes</h3>
<p>
There are five display modes avaliable
</p>
<h3>Selectig shown items</h3>
<h3>One view / four views toggle</h3>
<h3>Perspective mode toggle</h3>
<h3>Magnification control</h3>
<h3>Navigation modes</h3>

<p><big>
The views of the Layout Window and the Object Editor Windows follow the same set of rules, except that object editors cannot be assigned with cameras.
</big></p>

<h4>Default settings</h4>
<p>
<note>...Hmmm... wonder if that is needed...</note>
</p>
<h4>4/1 view modes</h4>
<p>In four view mode you can work on the model through any of the views. Also all the views can be oriented independently. You don't have to stick to the preset orientations.</p>
<p>Note that, if a view oriantation is set to a Camera, moving and rotating the view will also move the camera. This is especially handy to find camera angles or to record camera movements for animation or to aim spotlights to their targets.</p>

<p>Usually it is easier to edit a scene/object through one large view rather than four small ones.</p>

<p>To switch to one view mode, select View/One View. The active view will be expanded to fill the entire viewing area. This may also be a camera view. To switch back use the same menu selection, which will be now called Four View. The keyboard shotcut to toggle between one and four views is Ctrl+B.</p>
