<h1>User interface</h1>
<hr>

<h2>User preferences</h2>
<p><big>
The preferences setting dialog can be found at the bottom of the Edit menu.
</big></p>

<h3>Language selection</h3>
<p>
You can select the language of the userinterface in the drop down menu on the top of the Preference dialog. 
</p>
--image--


<p>When you change the language, the new setting affects only the new windows and dialogs in the session. It is recommended to restart after changing the language.</p>

<p>The selected language does not affect default names of the objects or any internal functions of the software. It only translates the user interface.</p>

<p>Unfortunately many of the translations are incomplete. The default translation for any missing texts is (US) English. If you wish to contribute to improving any of the translatiosn, you can start by having a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ArtOfIllusion/ArtOfIllusion/tree/master/ArtOfIllusion/src">translation files</a> on Github.</p>

<h3>Preferences file</h3>

<p>Your preferences setting are stored in a folder called <em>.artofillusion</em> under your personal user directory. The folder may appear hidden on your system. An individual preferences folder will be created for username, that uses Art of Illusion. </p>

<p>The two files, that belong to Art of Illusion core software are: 

<dl>
<dt><em>aoiprefs</em></dt>
  <dd></p>The settings from the 'General'-tab on the preferences dialog.</p></dd>
<dt><em>keystrokes.xml</em></dt>
  <dd><p>The programmable keyboard shortcuts form the 'Shortcuts'  tab on the preferences dialog. Some most used shorcuts are hardcoded an can not be changed but there are plenty of editable ones, that are adapted to each different diffent editor.</p>
  <p>To edit or add your own shortcuts you should familiarize yourself with <a href="">scripting</a>.</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The files are automatically generated text files and it is possible to read and edit the files by a text editor but editing is not recommended. Editing shoud happen through the Preferences dialog.</p>

<p>Deleting a preferences file or the folder reset prefrences. The folder and/or file will be recreated, when you start Art of Illusion the next time.</p>
