<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="What is Art of Illusion?">What is Art of Illusion?</h2>
<p>
<big>
Art of Illusion is a 3D-graphics software for creating photorealistic <i>(or not so photorealistic)</i> still images and animations.
</big>
</p>

<div class="tba">a gif animation</div>

<p>The main drivers in developing this software have been easiness of use and open environment for development. The program is widely customizable and the program code is freely available on the development site.</p>

<h2 id="how">How does it work ?</h2>

<p>To create an image or a movie you first create a 3D-scene, which consists of threedimensional objects.</p>

<div class="tba">modeling time image</div>

<p>At simplest the objects may be simple forms like spheres or discs or they can represent more complex or organic shapes like buldings or animals. You may assign the objects with textures and materials to achieve the visual appearance you like. You can have the objects move and change shape in time to create an animation. You have several different options availabe for creating the lighting conditions you need.</p>

<div class="tba">texturing image (collage?)</div>

</p>To render an image or a movie you define a rendering sequence. There is a large variety of choices for image quality, illumination processing and animation parameters. Finally you start the renderer to create the image or the animated movie.</p>

<div class="tba">a final piece (possibly animated)</div>

<p>The file extension for Art of Illusion scenes files is .aoi. There are no separate file formats for objects, animations or assemblies. You can exchange information between scenes by copying or linking and you can import images to your scenes either for reference or to be used with textures or materials.</p>

<p>To lears to use Art of Illusion, please study this manual and try out some of the step-by-tep tutorials or tutorial videos on the <a href="https://www.artofillusion.org">homepages</a>.</p>

<h2 id="buildup">Software build-up</h2>

<p>Art of Illusion runs on <b>Java</b> versions 6 up. The software consists of the core software, that comes with the <b>installation package</b> and add-on parts, that may be compiled <b>plugins</b> or user editable <b>scripts</b>.<p>

<p><b>The core software</b> contains all the necessary tools to start modelling, texturing, animating and rendering but it is recommended to add at least a few of the most useful pluging enhancements. A full API <i>(application programming interface)</i> documentation is available on the homepages for scipts and plugins development.</p> 

<p><b>Plugins</b> can add a large variety of functions and properties to the core software. They can bring in new object types with the tools to work on them, add improved properties to the user interface, add new types of textures and material, add new properties to editors, add completely new tools.... Plugins are written in Java and compiled into .jar files, which can simply be added to the relevand directory under the instalation and they'll be immediately in use.</p> 

<p><b>Scripts</b> can add tools, construct objects or alter setting of the software. Art of Illusion supports two scripting languages, Groovy and Beanshell. The benefit in using scripts is, that they can be tailored for very specific needs. </p>

<p>The installation package comes with <b>a tool for retrieving extension parts</b> from an online library. Using the tool is not obligatory though: plugins and script can simply be <b>added manually</b> to their specific directories. Art of Illusion also provides a basic text editor for writing and editing scripts.</p>

<p>To find out more, please have a look at the <a href="">Writing plugins</a> and <a href="">Scripting</a> sections of the maunal or the <a href="https://github.com/ArtOfIllusion">software development site on Github</a>.</p>
