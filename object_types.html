<br>
There are 3 basic geometric primitives available in Art of Illusion: <b>cube</b>,
<b>sphere</b> and <b>cylinder</b> objects,
which can either be created using the modelling tool icons in the upper
left corner of the screen or via the top menu bar as follows:<br>
<br>
Using the modelling tool icons allows immediate creation of the
primitive. Simply click on the relevant icon:<br>
<br>
cube: <img src="modelling/cube.jpg"> sphere: <img src="modelling/sphere.jpg"> cylinder: <img src="modelling/cylinder.jpg">
<br>
<br>
then click and drag on any viewport to define two of its initial
dimensions. The 3rd dimension will have to be altered if necessary
using the scaling tool <img src="modelling/scale.jpg">
in one of the other viewports. Alternatively, holding shift while
dragging forces all 3 dimensions to be equal.<br>
<br>
<a name="cyl">For cylinders</a>, the top:bottom
ratio can be set to form tapered cylinders (including cones) prior to
drawing by double-clicking on the cylinder icon. This ratio can also be
edited after drawing (see <a href="editing_objects.html#edit_object">editing_objects</a>).
<table>

the primitive via the menu bar is achieved by selecting <b>Object
-&gt; Create Primitive </b>and then selecting the
appropriate shape. Cones can also be created directly using this
method. This method brings up a dialogue box similar to that on the
left which allows the exact size, position and orientation of the
object to be specified.</font></td>

<tr>
<td><font face="tahoma" size="2">Primitives
have limited use for creating realistic objects as such objects are
rarely that simple in real life. However they can be useful for
cartoon-like scenes or for building up more complex models using
Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) via the <a href="modelling_tools.html#boolean">Boolean tool</a>
like in the simple example on the right:<br>

Primitives are also important as they can be the starting points for
creating triangle meshes. See <a href="#triangle_meshes">2.1.4</a>
below.<br>

There is one other important primitive object: the <b>Null</b>
object. Null objects do not show up on renders as
they have no geometry. Their main use in is grouping other geometrical
objects together. For example
you might want to create a car out of a set of geometric objects
representing the car body, wheels,
windscreens etc. A neat way to keep all the parts together would be to
create a Null object and to group
the geometric objects as children of that Null (see the <a href="layout.html#object_list">Object List</a> for
more details). Nulls are represented as crosses in the viewports.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="curves"><strong><font color="#ff6633" size="4">2.1.2 Curves</font></strong></a><br>
<br>
These are one dimensional objects and thus are not directly visible when you
render a scene.
However, they can be used in a <a href="modelling_tools.html">variety
of ways</a> to create 3-D objects. <br>
<br>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><font face="tahoma" size="2">Curves
are created by defining a series of points in any of the viewports.
They can have one of two types of smoothing: 'Interpolating', for which
the curve is forced to pass through the points and 'Approximating'
where the curve does not have to pass through all the points but
is still controlled by them.<br>
<br>
To create a curve, click on <img src="modelling/inter_curve_icon.jpg"><br>
<br>
Then click a series of locations on a viewport to define the points as
shown on the right.  Shift-click to create a sharp corner.<br>
<br>
To define the last point on the curve and thus end curve point
definition, double click. If you wish to automatically close the curve,
press the control key and double click. Alternatively to end
the curve without adding more points, press Enter to end without
closing or control-Enter to close
the curve.
<p>
To control whether you are creating an interpolating or approximating curve,
double click <img src="modelling/inter_curve_icon.jpg">.  A window will appear
where you can select the type of curve to create.

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
Closed curves can also be filled to create 2D objects by converting
them to <a href="#triangle_meshes">triangle meshes</a>.<br>
<br>
Another way to create a curve is to use the polygon tool. A polygon is
any flat shape with 3 or more sides. To create a polygon curve, double
click on <img src="modelling/polygon.jpg"> which brings
up this dialogue box: <br>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>

<td><font face="tahoma" size="2">You
can specify how many sides the polygon has and the type of smoothing of
the edges. Selecting 'angled' gives the polygon straight edges, while
choosing either 'interpolating' or 'approximating' creates rounded
edges. Because 'approximating' smoothing
does not require the curve to pass through all the points, this results
in a smaller overall shape for the 'approximating' polygon.</font></td>

dragging a rectangular area on one of the viewports to define its size.
<br>

Note: The Polygon tool can also be used to create 'filled polygon
surfaces' which are triangle
mesh objects. This is achieved by holding &lt;ctrl&gt; while
dragging. <br>

<b>Editing Curves</b><br>
<br>
Once polygon edges or curves have been created, the points defining
them can be edited by double-clicking on them in the Object List. For
example, double-clicking on the interpolated 3-sided polygon displays
the editing window below:<br>
<img src="modelling/editing_curve.jpg"><br>
Points are selected and deselected using the Select/Move tool. Multiple
points can be selected by pressing &lt;shift&gt; before
clicking on each point. Points can also be selected using a marquee
method by dragging a rectangular box over a group of points.
&lt;Shift&gt; selects works for the marquee selection also. All
points can be selected using the appropriate option from the Edit menu.<br>
<br>
To deselect points, simply click or &lt;shift&gt; click on
them. Alternatively a group of points can be deselected by pressing
&lt;ctrl&gt; and dragging a rectangle over the required points.
<br>
<br>
Selected points can be moved using the Select/Move tool or rotated,
skewed, scaled and tapered with the appropriate tools shown on the
left. Most of the tools activated from these icons are
self-explanatory. Resting the cursor over the icons will bring up a
tooltip to describe its function. The operation of most can be modified
by pressing &lt;shift&gt; or &lt;ctrl&gt; - see the
bottom of the editing window for details relevant to each tool.In
general, handles around the selected point(s) can be dragged to effect
the operation. Pressing &lt;shift&gt; while dragging causes the
operation to be a uniform one, whilst &lt;ctrl&gt; centres it.
The spacebar can be used to switch between tools quickly; pressing it
toggles between the
Select/Move tool and the last tool used.<br>
<br>
The view in the curve editor is controlled as in the main view windows,
i.e. yhrough use of the camera move/rotate icons or the keyboard
shortcuts. See <a href="layout.html#view_windows">here</a>
for more details.

Splines are smooth surfaces the shape of which are determined by
control points and the type of smoothing applied. &nbsp;Splines can
be created by applying the various <a href="modelling_tools.html">modelling_tools
</a>to existing objects (usually curves) or directly by clicking
on <img src="modelling/spline_icon.jpg">

doing that, you can select some of the spline properties by
double-clicking on that same icon. This brings up the dialogue box on
the right:<br>
<br>
<br>
The U and V size boxes determine the physical dimensions of the spline
mesh 'sheet', i.e the number of control points in each of the two
dimensions.<br>
<br>
<br>
The shape can be either flat, a cylinder or a torus. In the latter 2
cases, to understand the U and V dimensions it may help to think of a
rolled-up sheet. For a cylinder, U-size is the number of points around
the circumference and V-size is the number of points along its axis.
Similarly for a torus, U is along the circumference and V-size is the
number of points around the cross-section.<br>
<br>
<br>
The smoothing method can be either 'approximating' or 'interpolating'.
See <b><a href="object_types.html#curves">2.1.2</a></b>
for an explanation of these terms.<br>

Once the spline has been created, it can be edited by double-clicking
on the object in the Object List. This brings up an editing window
similar to this:<br>
<img src="modelling/spline_editting.jpg">
<br>
As in the <a href="layout.html#view_windows">main
viewports</a>, the orientation, scaling and type (parallel or
perspective) of view can be controlled using the familiar camera
control icons/keyboard shortcuts and drop down menus at the top of the
view. The type of shading can also be altered by selecting <b>Mesh
-&gt; Display Mode </b>(see <a href="layout.html#display_mode">Display Mode</a> for
details on this)<br>
<br>
The editing utility allows both <i>vertices</i> ('points')
or <i>curves</i> to be edited. The editing mode is
selected by clicking on the appropriate button at bottom left. The
icons on the left allow points and curves to be transformed in various
ways as identified on the diagram above. The points or curves to be
transformed must be selected first by clicking on individual points or
curves. Multiple
selections are achieved by holding down &lt;shift&gt; while
successively clicking on further points/curves. A marquee
('rubber band') selection is also possible and is performed by dragging
the mouse while holding the left mouse button to highlight a rectangle.
&nbsp;Note that for curves, you need to enclose the whole curve
within the selection marquee for this to work. &nbsp;Pressing
&lt;ctrl&gt; while clicking or dragging a marquee de-selects
all currently selected points/curves. There is also a freehand
selection mode
which is enabled through the<a href="#spline_edit_menu">
Edit</a> menu. &nbsp;Having selected the vertices/curves to
edit, the tool is actioned by dragging on the red arrow handles that

Triangle meshes are similar to spline meshes in that they are a way of
creating complex surfaces. The surfaces, however, are not defined by
curves as in the case of splines, but through a mesh of triangular
facets. The example below shows the difference between a sphere surface
represented by a spline mesh and by a triangular mesh: <br>
<img src="modelling/spline_v_tri.jpg"><br>
<br>
The fact that the surface is composed of triangles means that triangle
meshes are more versatile than spline meshes. Meshes are either created
directly from objects or by using modelling_tools on existing mesh
objects (see <a href="modelling_tools.html">
modelling_tools</a>).<br>
<br>
To create a triangle mesh version of any existing geometric object,
simply click on the object in the Object List and select <b>Object
-&gt; Convert to Triangle Mesh. </b>Depending on the
selected object, you may be prompted for a surface accuracy. This is
because most geometries contain curves which can only be approximated
with a mesh and so you need to tell the program how accurate to be.
Basically, the lower the surface accuracy specified, the greater the
number of triangles making up the mesh. It is worth bearing in mind,
however, that you do not necessarily need to specify a particularly
high accuracy as the smoothing options that the mesh is capable of will
be able to produce smooth meshes from a relatively few number of
points/triangular faces. Converting a cube to a triangle mesh can be
done exactly and so there is no prompt for accuracy.<br>
<br>
Double-clicking on a triangle mesh object brings up the triangle mesh
editor as shown below. Meshes can be edited in either point, edge or
face mode by selecting the appropriate button from bottom left.<br>
<img src="modelling/mesh_editor.jpg"><br>
<br>
As in the <a href="layout.html#view_windows">main
viewports</a>, the orientation, scaling and type (parallel or
perspective) of view can be controlled using the familiar camera
control icons/keyboard shortcuts and drop down menus at the top of the
view. The type of shading can also be altered by selecting <b>Mesh
-&gt; Display Mode </b>(see <a href="layout.html#display_mode">Display Mode</a> for

The icons on the left side are largely the same as for the spline mesh
editor. There are
additional tools for triangle meshes, though, and each tool can be
applied to points, edges or faces. Most of these tools are fairly
self-explanatory. Resting the cursor over the icons will bring up a
tooltip to describe its function.
The operation of most can be modified by pressing &lt;shift&gt;
or &lt;ctrl&gt; - see the bottom of the editing window for
details relevant to each tool. The spacebar can be used to switch
between tools quickly; pressing it toggles between the

<a name="Bevel_tool">The Bevel/Extrude</a> tool <img src="modelling/bevel_icon.jpg"> is a very powerful way of
extending the mesh geometry. This tool works in exactly the same way as
the Bevel/Extrude function accessible from the
Mesh menu (see below) but in a more interactive way. Bevel and extrude
can be applied in a single
operation to vertices, edges or faces and the resulting geometry is
left selected to allow further
bevel/extrudes to be applied immediately. To use the tool, select the
geometry to be bevelled/extrude
using the Move/Select tool. Then select the Bevel/Extrude tool and the
mode of operation (i.e.
point/edge/face). Dragging up/down on the viewport extrudes the
geometry and dragging left/right
applies a bevel. The operation can be constrained to a pure extrude by
Shift dragging up/down and
constrained to a pure bevel by Shift clicking left/right. The images
below show the results of
applying this tool to some sample geometry in the different modes. Note
that for faces, double-clicking
the icon displays a dialogue that allows faces to be extruded as
separate entities or on the selection
as a whole.<br>

Subdivision works differently depending on which smoothing method (see <a href="#smoothing">below</a>) is

<br>
<b>Simplify Selection </b>- Reduces the number of points

<b>Edit Points</b> allows you to specify absolute x, y and
z co-ordinates for selected points and to specify skeleton properties

'Shading' gives an illusion of slight smoothing by altering surface
normals. 'Interpolating' and 'Approximating' actually change the
geometry of the object and are very powerful subdivision methods which
are excellent for organic objects. The image on the right
shows the difference between them for a simple object which was created
by converting a cube into a triangle mesh. Also remember that the
smoothness of individual points or edges can also be controlled using
the Set Smoothness tool described above.<br>

Skeletons are not objects in themselves but they are a very useful
method of controlling the deformation of mesh objects. Their greatest
use is in animation and this is detailed <a href="animation.html#pose_tracks">here</a>.
<br>
<br>
The basic premise of skeletons is that you create a chain of 'bones'
which is attached to the mesh. Movement
of the bones is then achieved through 1 of 2 distinct methods:<br>
<br>
<b>Forward Kinematics (FK)</b>: Clicking on a bone joint
displays FK handles which allow the bone to be
rotated, twisted or stretched relative to its parent.<br>
<br>
<b>Inverse Kinematics (IK)</b>: Various joints can be
anchored or 'pinned'. Other
joints can then be grabbed and moved to the required position; other
bones between that joint and any
pinned joints will then move automatically through a process called
Inverse Kinematics to maintain the skeleton links. <br>
<br>
In either case, as the bones move, the mesh will deform to keep up with
them.<br>

existing bones.<br>
<br>
The 'base' joint is shown in green. Any existing joint can temporarily
be made a 'base' by &lt;shift&gt;
clicking it. This is a way of restricting movements of the skeleton;
any bones between the base and the root will remain fixed while bones
further towards the extremity will be able to move. Art of
Illusion allows any number of bone joints to be anchored or 'pinned' in
this way. </font></td>

<b><font color="#0000ff">BINDING THE SKELETON TO THE
MESH</font></b><br>
<br>
Having drawn the skeleton, it needs to be attached to the mesh. To do
this, select all the points in
the mesh and click on <b>Skeleton -&gt; Bind Points to
Skeleton </b>. The following dialogue will be displayed:<br>
<br>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="modelling/ik_weight_dial.jpg"></td>
<td><font face="tahoma" size="2">The IK
(Inverse Kinematics) Weight defines how the mesh will deform as
the bones attached to it
move. If the IK Weight of a point was set to 1.0, then it would be
affected only by the nearest bone. This can lead to problems where
adjacent points are nearest to different bones. In this case, one point
would move with one bone and its neighbour would not. To overcome this,
Art of Illusion can make points be affected not only by the nearest
bone but also by that bone's parent (i.e. the next bone towards the
root). When the skeleton is bound to the mesh using this dialogue, the
program blends these weights to make the surface move smoothly; points
near the centre of the bone will have weights close to 1 whereas points
near joints will have lower weights. The IK Weight Blending value
defined here sets the size of the region around each joint that will
use lower weights. </font></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
If the IK Weight Blending was set to 0, there would be no blending and
that all points would be bound
with an IK Weight of 1 (e.g. a rigid robotic arm). A blending of 1 is
the other extreme and would b
useful for something like a flexible garden hose.<br>
<br>
The IK Weight Blending defined at this stage is a global control on all
points attached to the skeleton. To
define more specific control on particular points, you can select the
relevant points and select
<b>Mesh -&gt; Edit Points </b>. The lower part of this
dialogue allows you to select which bone you want
the points to be controlled by and which IK weight to apply as shown
below: <br>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="modelling/skeleton_edit_IK_weight.jpg"></td>
<td><font face="tahoma" size="2">Just
to reiterate, the IK Weight is the relative effect of the nearest
bone over its parent bone, so a value of 0.5 means that the point is
affected equally by the nearest bone and its parent, a value of 0.8
means that the effect of the nearest bone predominates over its parent.
(80% vs 20%). </font></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
Note that only part of the mesh can be bound to the skeleton if
required. When binding, simply select
the points you want to bind and click on <b>Skeleton -&gt;
Bind Points to Skeleton </b>. This is useful
if you have altered the skeleton but have already fine-tuned the IK
weights on other parts of the skeleton.
In this case binding all points would mean you would have to start
adjusting IK weights all over again.
Instead just select those vertices around the altered bones and bind
those.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#0000ff">EDITING THE SKELETON</font></b><br>
<br>
The bones in the skeleton can be moved using Forward Kinematics (FK) or
Inverse Kinematics (IK). With
FK, bones are moved individually with their parent bone being fixed. FK
movements can be conveniently
effected via the FK handles attached to the selected joint. The handles
are shown as small red squares
attached to the joint by a line, as shown below. The number of handles
available depends on the unlocked degrees of freedom and the FK handle
setting. By default, there are 2 unlocked degrees of freedom; X bend
and Y bend and the FK handle setting is set to display unlocked degrees
of freedom only.<br>
<br>
To allow alteration of the other degrees of freedom, the Edit Bone
dialogue (see below) can be used to unlock the 2 other degrees of
freedom: Twist and Length. Alternatively, the
currently locked degrees of freedom can be made to display, and allow
alteration of, their FK handles. The
FK handle setting, which allows this, is set by double-clicking on the
skeleton icon. This gives
3 options: (i) display of only unlocked degrees of freedom, (ii) No FK
handles at all or (iii) All FK handles. Note that unlocking the degrees
of freedom via the Edit Bone dialogue means that
they will unlocked when manipulating bones via IK, unlike changing the
FK display setting.<br>
<br>
To move the bone, click on the appropriate handle. For X and Y bend
handles, this displays a circle centred on the parent joint which
shows the possible range of motion (see figure below). Dragging the
mouse left/right with the left mouse depressed will
rotate the bone and constrain the motion to that relevant degree of
freedom.<br>
<br>
<img src="modelling/skeleton_FK_handles.jpg"><br>
<br>
The alternative method of moving bones is using Inverse Kinematics
(IK). With IK, you can anchor or 'pin'
any of the bone joints by pressing &lt;shift&gt; and clicking
on them - this will turn them green. To move the skeleton, click on any
of the unpinned
joints and drag it; the IK solver in Art of Illusion will automatic
calculate the position of
the bones between that joint and any pinned joints in order to maintain
the skeleton links.<br>
<br>
<br>
If, after creating and binding the skeleton, there is a need to
reposition any of the bones without affecting
the pose of the object, then select <b>Skeleton -&gt;
Temporarily Detach Skeleton </b>. Once the skeleton
is correctly positioned, then select the <b>Skeleton -&gt;
Temporarily Detach Skeleton </b> to toggle this option
off again. It may also be necessary to rebind the skeleton at this
stage to ensure that the vertices are assigned to the appropriate bones.<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#0000ff">SETTING MOVEMENT
RESTRICTIONS</font></b><br>
<br>
By default, the bones' rotations are not restricted. As well as being
physically unrealistic, this can soon lead to problems when moving
bones using IK . To avoid this, the movements of each bone can be
limited. This is done by clicking
on the joint at the end of the bone and selecting <b>Skeleton
-&gt; Edit Bone </b>. This will display a dialogue similar
to that below:<br>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="modelling/edit_bone.jpg"></td>
<td><font face="tahoma" size="2">At the
top is the name of the bone and this can be changed to anything
you like.<br>
<br>
The next 2 properties that can be altered are the <b>X-bend</b>
and <b>Y-bend</b>. These are rotations of the bone around
the parent joint (the one at the thin end of the kite) and can either
be left and right or forward and
backward. One will be the X-bend and the other the Y-bend. As you
change the values in these boxes, the
skeleton be be updated in real time. The circular device shown beside
each type of angular motion can also
be used to move bones. The black square handle on the outer circle can
be grabbed and moved around to
alter the relevant degree of motion.<br>
<br>
Rotation around either the X or Y direction can be completely disabled
by checking
the <b>Lock</b> box. Alternatively, the maximum angles of
bend in each direction can be restricted by checking the <b>Restrict
Total Range </b> box and then entering the extreme values in the
2 boxes below. This 'blacks out' the forbidden range of angles in the
circular device. In addition, you can set another range with the <b>Restrict
Comfort Range</b> which is the range that
the bone will normally reside in and will only go outside when forced
to. The circular device shows in
grey the range of angles outside of the Comfort Range. Finally there is
the ability
to set the <b>Stiffness</b> of the joint which is a way of
making some joints in the chain more easily bent
than others.<br>
</font></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
<br>
Apart from be able to bend the joint, there is the ability to <b>Twist</b>
it, i.e. spin it around its
axis. The controls on this are the same as the X and Y bends.<br>
<br>
Finally there is the <b>Length</b> control which allows
the bone to be stretched and compressed along
its length. Again there is the ability to control the total and confort
ranges as well as the stiffness. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#0000ff">THE SKELETON MENU</font></b><br>
<br>
Just to end off the section on skeletons we will look at the Skeleton
Menu accessible from the top
menu bar. It looks like this:<br>
<br>
<table>

</font></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
<br>
<b>Set Parent Bone</b> allows the bone hierarchy to be
restructured. This is particularly useful for
rearranging bone set up after or before deleting bones. Take the
example below:<br>
<br>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="modelling/skeleton_set_parent.jpg"></td>
<td><font face="tahoma" size="2">[LEFT]
Let's say I wanted to delete the bone between joints 2 and 3 in
the top diagram. The parent joint
of this bone is 2. If I selected joint 3 and tried to delete it, I
would have to delete all the
children of that bone as well, i.e. all the finger joints.<br>
<br>
However it can be done as follows. First we change the parent of bone 4
from its current parent, i.e. 3,
to 2. This is done by selecting bone 4, clicking on <b>Skeleton
-&gt; Set Parent</b> and choosing Bone 2
from the list. The bone hierarchy changes as shown in the centre
diagram.<br>
<br>
All we need to do now is select the unwanted bone and delete it.<br>
<br>
[BELOW] Bones can be inserted in a similar way - effectively we replace
one existing bone with 2 or more.
Click on the bone to replace and set its parent bone to None - this
will break the bone chain. Now select the bone onto which you want to
join the new bones and Ctrl click the new bones as usual.
To join the last bone onto the end of the rest of the bone chain,
select the end of the chain and
set its parent to the last new bone.<br>

<br>
<b>Import Skeleton</b> allows the skeleton of another
object in the scene to be imported into the
current mesh.<br>
<br>
<b>Bind Points to Skeleton</b> links the skeleton to the
mesh so that moving bones will deform the mesh. See above for details.<br>
<br>
<b>Detach Points from Bone</b> detaches all points from the currently selected bone
so that they are no longer bound to the skeleton.<br>
<br>
<b>Temporarily Detach Skeleton</b> switches off the link

<a name="tubes"><strong><font color="#ff6633" size="4">2.1.6. Tube Objects</font></strong></a><br>
<br>
<br>
Tube objects are created by using the <a href="modelling_tools.html#tube">Tube tool</a> on a
curve. This produces an extruded surface that
has a circular cross-section. Tube objects can be edited by
double-clicking them in the Object List or
by clicking right and selecting <b>Edit Object</b>. This
displays the Tube Object editor as shown below:<br>
<br>
<img src="modelling/edit_tube.jpg"><br>
<br>
This editor is very similar to the Spline and Triangle Mesh editors
described above. There are less icon
tools available as these objects are inherently less flexible. Resting
the cursor
over the icons will bring up a tooltip to describe its function. The
spacebar can be used to switch between tools quickly; pressing it
toggles between the
Select/Move tool and the last tool used. The Tube surface is controlled
by a set of
points connected by straight lines, effectively a curve. This defines
the shape of the tube centres. The diameter of the cross section can be
specified at each point on the curve.<br>
<br>
The top menu bar is also similar to the other object editors:<br>
<br>

Reference image planes (RIPs) are non-renderable objects that are used
as a guide during modelling etc. &nbsp;To insert an RIP, select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Object -&gt; Create Primitive<span style="font-weight: bold;"> -&gt; Reference Image</span></span>.

up on the view windows projected onto a plane object. &nbsp;This
object
can be transformed in the same way as other objects - the only
difference is that it does not show up on the rendered image.
&nbsp;As
